Operational and Safety Risk: As the core business involves large-scale industrial plants, the Company must maintain safety standards, production stability, and energy efficiency to prevent unexpected production shutdowns. 2. Cyber Threat Risk: Risks arising from diverse cyberattacks against Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems, which could impact data security and production processes. 3. Sustainable Feedstock Risk: The volume of gas in the Gulf of Thailand is trending downwards, impacting costs and competitiveness; this necessitates management to source alternative feedstocks and import from overseas. 4. Decarbonization Implementation Risk: Challenges in driving carbon reduction projects to achieve Net Zero goals through Efficiency-driven, Portfolio-driven, and Compensation-driven approaches, including the utilization of CCS technology and clean energy. 5. Regulatory and Consumer Trend Risk: Stricter environmental regulations, such as the draft Climate Change Act and plastic management policies, as well as new fuel price structures that may impact costs and competitive potential.","The Company is committed to Innovation Management to support research and the creation of innovations that enhance competitiveness and reduce environmental impacts. Strategies are defined in three formats: 1) Strengthening the Core: Upgrading technology to increase competitiveness, such as through Process Innovation and Product Innovation; 2) Striving the Growth: Exploring opportunities in new businesses and continuously developing innovations; and 3) Sustaining the Future: Seeking future business opportunities that address market needs, such as sustainable composite materials and carbon capture.
