      "Prediction of Performer Attentiveness Based on Rehearsal Activity and Teacher Behavior The purpose of this study was to examine videotaped teacher and performer behavior during several high school ensemble rehearsals to determine the predictability of a dependent variable, frequency of off-task behavior, by the following carrier variables: performance time; nonperformance time; frequency of social and academic approvals and disapprovals, stops, complete and incomplete teaching units, errors, and teacher eye contact. Subjects were six high school ensemble teachers and randomly selected students from two mixed choruses, three bands, and one orchestra. Videotapes, using two cameras and a special effects generator for a split-screen effect, were made for ex post facto analysis. The predictability of off task behavior carrier variables was ex amined, using a multiple regression analysis. The variability of off-task behavior caused by individual teacher differences was accounted for in a repeated measures design. Results indicated a strong relationship between off-task behavior and individ ual teachers, nonperformance activity, and teacher eye contact. The carrier variables in this model accounted for 81.38% of the off-task variability. \n",

      "Max at Seventeen Computer Music Journal, 26:4, pp. 31–43, Winter 2002 2002 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have worked for many years on a computer environment for realizing live electronic music that I named in honor of Max Mathews. Three currently supported computer programs—Max/MSP, jmax, and Pd—can be considered as extended implementations of a common paradigm I refer to here as ‘‘Max.’’ The Max paradigm appears to be stable enough now that a printed description of it no longer risks becoming too quickly outdated. We can now usefully assess what Max (the paradigm) does well, what it does less well, and what we can all learn from the experience. The Dartmouth Symposium on the Future of Music Software, organized by Eric Lyon, offers the perfect occasion to start this project. I apologize in advance if, for obvious reasons, parts of this article might not seem perfectly objective or impartial. The Max paradigm can be described as a way of combining pre-designed building blocks into configurations useful for real-time computer music performance. This includes a protocol for scheduling controland audio-rate computations, an approach to modularization and component intercommunication, and a graphical representation and editor for patches. These components are realized differently in different implementations, and each implementation offers a variety of extensions to the common paradigm. On the surface, Max appears to be mostly concerned with presenting a suitable graphical user interface for describing real-time MIDI and audio computations. However, the graphical look and editing functions in Max are not highly original, and most of what is essentially Max lies beneath the surface. In my experience, computer music software most often arises as a result of interactions between artists and software writers (occasionally embodied in the same person, but not in my own case). This interaction is at best one of mutual enabling and mutual respect. The design of the software cannot help but affect what computer music will sound like, but we software writers must try not to project our own musical ideas through the software. In the best of circumstances, the artists remind us of their needs—which often turn out quite different from what either of us first imagined. To succeed as computer music software writers, then, we need close exposure to high-caliber artists representing a wide variety of concerns. Only then can we can identify features that can solve a variety of different problems when in the hands of very different artists. Many of the underlying ideas behind Max arose in the rich atmosphere of the MIT Experimental Music Studio in the early 1980s (which became part of the MIT Media Lab at its inception). Max took its modern shape during a heated, excited period of interaction and ferment among a small group of researchers, composers, and performers at IRCAM during the period 1985–1990; writing Max would probably not have been possible in less stimulating and demanding surroundings. In the same way, Pd’s development a decade later would not have been possible without the participation of the artists and other researchers of the Global Visual Music Project, of which I was a part. My work on Max and its implementations has been in essence an attempt to capture these encounters in software, and a study of Max will succeed best if it considers the design issues and the artistic issues together.\n",

      "Rethinking the Computer Music Language: SuperCollider ion Description and Purpose Variable names Provide human readable names to data addresses Function names Provide human readable names to function addresses Control structures Eliminate ‘‘spaghetti’’ code (The ‘‘goto’’ statement is no longer necessary.) Argument passing Default argument values, keyword specification of arguments, variable length argument lists, etc. Data structures Allow conceptual organization of data Data typing Binds the type of the data to the type of the variable Static Insures program correctness, sacrificing generality. Dynamic Greater generality, sacrificing guaranteed correctness. Inheritance Allows creation of families of related types and easy re-use of common functionality Message dispatch Providing one name to multiple implementations of the same concept Single dispatch Dispatching to a function based on the run-time type of one argument Multiple dispatch Dispatching to a function based on the run-time type of multiple arguments. Predicate dispatch Dispatching to a function based on run-time state of arguments Garbage collection Automated memory management Closures Allow creation, combination, and use of functions as first-class values Lexical binding Provides access to values in the defining context Dynamic binding Provides access to values in the calling context (.valueEnvir in SC) Co-routines Synchronous cooperating processes Threads Asynchronous processes Lazy evaluation Allows the order of operations not to be specified. Infinitely long processes and infinitely large data structures can be specified and used as needed. Applying Language Abstractions to Computer Music The SuperCollider language provides many of the abstractions listed above. SuperCollider is a dynamically typed, single-inheritance, single-argument dispatch, garbage-collected, object-oriented language similar to Smalltalk (www.smalltalk.org). In SuperCollider, everything is an object, including basic types like letters and numbers. Objects in SuperCollider are organized into classes. The UGen class provides the abstraction of a unit generator, and the Synth class represents a group of UGens operating as a group to generate output. An instrument is constructed functionally. That is, when one writes a sound-processing function, one is actually writing a function that creates and connects unit generators. This is different from a procedural or static object specification of a network of unit generators. Instrument functions in SuperCollider can generate the network of unit generators using the full algorithmic capability of the language. For example, the following code can easily generate multiple versions of a patch by changing the values of the variables that specify the dimensions (number of exciters, number of comb delays, number of allpass delays). In a procedural language like Csound or a ‘‘wire-up’’ environment like Max, a different patch would have to be created for different values for the dimensions of the patch.\n",

      "Generative theories in language and music descriptions Abstract The style of a set of Swedish nursery tunes is described in terms of a generative rule system. A generative rule system producing melodically similar versions of an old Swedish folk song is also presented. Examples of melodies generated by these two rule systems are given. Both these rule systems are similar in several respects. Thus, the marking of the hierarchical constituent structure seems to be one of the important principles in composing simple melodies. The rule systems also show a number of similarities with the Chomsky & Halle (1968) generative phonology of English. For instance, the procedures used for deriving a stress contour from a tree diagram are almost identical. Moreover, in sentences as in melodies this stress, or prominence contour is of decisive importance to the generation of the surface structure, such as meter, harmony, and sequences of pitches. It is believed that such parallels between language and music reflect characteristics of man's perceptual and cognitive capacities.\n",

      "On Musical Mediation: Ontology, Technology and Creativity This article develops a theoretical analysis of music and mediation, building on the work of Theodor Adorno, Tia DeNora and Antoine Hennion. It begins by suggesting that Lydia Goehr’s account of the work concept requires such a perspective. Drawing on Alfred Gell’s anthropology of art, the article outlines an approach to mediation that incorporates understandings of music’s social, technological and temporal dimensions. It suggests that music’s mediations have taken a number of historical forms, which cohere into assemblages, and that we should be alert to shifts in the dominant forms of musical assemblage. In the latter part of the article, these tools are used to conceptualize changing forms of musical creativity that emerged over the twentieth century. A comparison is made between the work concept and jazz and improvised electronic musics. Three contemporary digital music experiments are discussed in detail, demonstrating the concepts of the provisional work and of social, distributed and relayed creativity. Throughout, key motifs are mediation, creativity, and the negotiation of difference.\n",

      "Determination of the meter of musical scores by autocorrelation A single voice extracted from the scores of compositions from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary periods has been studied in order to determine the feasibility of the determination of musical meter by computer. The method of autocorrelation is appropriate for this calculation since it is a measure of the frequency of occurrence of events following an event at time zero. If a greater frequency of events occurs on the downbeat of a measure as predicted by Palmer and Krumhansl [‘‘Mental Representations for Musical Meter,’’ J. Exp. Psychol.: Hum. Percept. Perform. 16, 728–741 (1990)], then a peak in the autocorrelation function should indicate the time for a single measure. The results of these computations indicate that computer determination of meter from score events is indeed possible. An example is included to show that this method of analysis can be applied to live performance data as well.\n",

      "Is There Love in the Telematic Embrace? The past decade has seen the two powerful technologies of computing and telecommunications converge into one field of operations that has drawn into its embrace other electronic media, including video, sound synthesis, remote sensing, and a variety of cybernetic systems. These phenomena are exerting enormous influence upon society and on individual behavior; they seem increasingly to be calling into question the very nature of what it is to be human, to be creative, to think and to perceive, and indeed our relationship to each other and to the planet as a whole. The “telematic culture” that accompanies the new developments consists of a set of behaviors, ideas, media, values, and objectives that are significantly unlike those that have shaped society since the Enlightenment. New cultural and scientific metaphors and paradigms are being generated, new models and representations of reality are being invented, new expressive means are being manufactured.\n",

      "A Sweet Lullaby for World Music 1. Music’s deep connection to social identities has been distinctively intensified by globalization. This intensification is due to the ways cultural separation and social exchange are mutually accelerated by transnational flows of technology, media, and popular culture. The result is that musical identities and styles are more visibly transient, more audibly in states of constant fission and fusion than ever before. 2. Our era is increasingly dominated by fantasies and realizations of sonic virtuality. Not only does contemporary technology make all musical worlds actually or potentially transportable and hearable in all others, but this transportability is something fewer and fewer people take in any way to be remarkable. As sonic virtuality is increasingly naturalized, everyone’s musical world will be felt and experienced as both more definite and more vague, specific yet blurred, particular but general, in place and in motion. 3. It has taken only one hundred years for sound recording technologies to amplify sonic exchange to a point that overwhelms prior and contiguous his-\n",

      "The Invention of African Rhythm \"African ryhthm\" was invented in the 1950s when, thanks to pioneering research by the Reverend A. M. Jones, Alan Merriam, Gilbert Rouget, Erich von Hornbostel, and John Blacking, among others, \"African music\" was construed as an essentially rhythmic phenomenon. Three decades and a sizable body of empirical research later, it is easy to see that an overriding ideology of difference (between \"Africa\" and the \"West\") motivated these early efforts. This essay reinvents \"African rhythm\" not by denying its own ideological construction but by engaging in an imaginary dialogue with earlier researchers in an effort to concretize that which was missing from their representations. In it, I develop a view of African rhythm in which its mechanical aspects (grouping, accents, periodicity) are shown to reside in broader patterns of temporal signification (movement, language and gesture). Although this is a less elegant proposition (in the mathematical sense), it is phenomenologically truer to the African experience. The latter, in turn, is not a mystified precolonial essence but the more \"contaminated\" and inherently contradictory condition of postcoloniality itself. \"African music\" in this construction is not synonymous with \"African rhythm,\" although the latter's apparent complexity, explicitly thematized in earlier writings, reemerges against a richer conceptual background.\n",

A listening test was administered to 107 students in four classes in central Michigan. Test reliability was evaluated in terms of common factor concentration and stability across time, and behavior observation was used to help interpret results. A preference hierarchy emerged in which the popular styles were most favored and correlation analysis indicated that style was most strongly related to preference. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance disclosed a significant three-way interaction. An examination of charted cell means indicated a strong effect for style, which was notice ably suppressed by performance in the instrumental medium. Across pooled styles there was a slight preference for faster tempos and the instrumental medium. \n",

Hip-hop, as an example of informal musical learning, has so far been quite an unexplored field for research. The present study investigates music creation within two hip-hop groups (communes) in Sweden. The focus is on the creative learning process and the meeting between music and lyrics (the texts). The groups were given a beat/background, composed by a 'beatmaker', on the basis of which they were asked to create a hip-hop tune. The process, which took place in a recording studio with a sound engineer, was observed and videotaped. After the recording sessions, both groups watched the videotape and made comments on their working processes (stimulated recall). Pre-interviews were carried out with both groups, and in addition, the 'beatmaker' was interviewed. The results show that in the creative process, which is collective in character, the ly...\n",

The theories of imitation help structure one's expectations as to the types of relations between text and model which one is likely to find, although they also amount to a strong warning against the difficulties of discovering and analyzing these relations.\n",

      "Enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity proton–proton collisions AbstractAt sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the quark–gluon plasma (QGP)1. Such an exotic state of strongly interacting quantum chromodynamics matter is produced in the laboratory in heavy nuclei high-energy collisions, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is observed2,3,4,5,6. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of QGP formation in nuclear collisions7, is more pronounced for multi-strange baryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed in high-multiplicity proton–proton (pp) collisions8,9, but the enhanced production of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we present the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity proton–proton collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange particles, relative to pions, increases significantly with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with the p–Pb collision results10,11, indicating that the phenomenon is related to the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events strangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in Pb–Pb collisions, where a QGP is formed.\n",

      "Live coding in laptop performance Seeking new forms of expression in computer music, a small number of laptop composers are braving the challenges of coding music on the fly. Not content to submit meekly to the rigid interfaces of performance software like Ableton Live or Reason, they work with programming languages, building their own custom software, tweaking or writing the programs themselves as they perform. Often this activity takes place within some established language for computer music like SuperCollider, but there is no reason to stop errant minds pursuing their innovations in general scripting languages like Perl. This paper presents an introduction to the field of live coding, of real-time scripting during laptop music performance, and the improvisatory power and risks involved. We look at two test cases, the command-line music of slub utilising, amongst a grab-bag of technologies, Perl and REALbasic, and Julian Rohrhuber's Just In Time library for SuperCollider. We try to give a flavour of an exciting but hazardous world at the forefront of live laptop performance.\n",

      "Participatory Discrepancies and the Power of Music The power of music is in its participatory discrepancies, and these are basically of two kinds: processual and textural. Music, to be personally involving and socially valuable, must be \"out of time\" and \"out of tune.\" For \"participatory discrepancies\" one could substitute \"inflection,\" \"articulation,\" \"creative tensions,\" \"relaxed dynamisms,\" \"semiconscious or unconscious slightly out of syncnesses.\" For \"process\" one could substitute \"beat,\" \"drive,\" \"groove,\" \"swing,\" \"push,\" etc., and for \"texture\" one could substitute \"timbre,\" \"sound,\" \"tone qualities,\" \"as arranged by,\" and so forth. The fact that these musical essentials are barely \"figured\" in Owen Barfield's sense (1965:24ff., 188) and certainly not \"collectively represented\" with any great clarity in language (1965: 41, 111, 122, 154-155) is evidence, I believe, of their original or active participatory power (1965:2845). Put another way, wherever \"lexical meanings\" are various and ambiguous for a particular phenomenon, one can assume a lot of collective and individual unconsciousness and conversely a greater power for \"speaker's meanings\" (Barfield 1984) to define situations.\n",

It begins with historical events, cultural trends, and individual occurrences that led up to the emergence of the classic somatic methods at the turn of the twentieth century (Alexander to Trager). It then defines somatic movement education and therapy, and the growth of three generations of somatic movement programmes. Interview data reveals how a second generation included a large proportion of dancers and speaks to how the bodymind thinking of dance professionals continues to shape the training and development of somatic education, as well as dance somatics. Finally it raises the question of the marginalizing of both dance and somatic education, and points to combining forces with their shared characteristics to alter this location in western culture. Another finding seeks to assess the potency and placement of somatic dance in a global schema.\n",

Anthropologists have played a critical role in this new dance scholarship, contributing comparative analyses, critiquing colonial and ethnocentric categories, and situating studies of dance and movement within broader frameworks of embodiment and the politics of culture. This review highlights ethnographic and historical studies that foreground dance and other structured movement systems in the making of colonial cultures; the constitution of gender, ethnic and national identities; the formation of discourses of exoticization; and the production of social bodies.

Born in Prague in 1930, he was inspired early in his life by the discovery of unscored Indian classical music. Nettl and his family moved to the USA in 1939, and in 1964 he began teaching at the University of Illinois. Much of his most important work has been done with the music of indigenous peoples in North America, Iran, and South India. In 1983 Nettl published his seminal work The Study of Ethnomusicology: Twenty-Nine Issues and Concepts (revised and reissued in 2005). In 1998, with Melinda Russell, he edited In the Course Of Performance: Studies in the World of Musical Improvisation, and in 2009, with Gabriel Solis, he edited Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society. Four decades after it appeared, “Thoughts on Improvisation” remains an invaluable introduction to the worldwide practice of musical improvisation, which in fact questions the ways in which we compartmentalise music-making: “Should we not then speak perhaps of rapid and slow composition rather than of composition juxtaposed to improvisation?”\n",

      "Ballet as ideology:Giselle,Act II In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the social nature of art production. This interest is frequently opposed from within traditional aesthetics on the grounds that it reduces art to a social symptom and thus fundamentally misses the locus of aesthetic value. Conventional aesthetics assumes that artistic expression exists most importantly within an autonomous aesthetic realm-that works of art indeed reflect society, but that this reflection should be understood from within a disinterested \"aesthetic attitude.\" The desire to preserve the aesthetic as a separate realm does not deny that art is a social product so much as it tends to isolate the social meanings of a work of art from those meanings that are seen to develop intrinsically, that are grounded in human universals rather than historical particulars. In this view the continued accessibility of classic works is taken to manifest the transhistorical qualities of art. The local conditions of production and historically specific ideas are seen to fall away, so that our present appreciation is of timeless essences.\n",

      "Shakespeare and Cultural Tourism Tourism, the world's largest industry, despite derision and sleaze, is ever more important in global cultural life. All of us are tourists now and then, reluctantly or eagerly visiting the exotic, consuming the foreign, watching the great universal show. The past is particularly important for tourism: jet travel since about 1960 has become a form of time travel, allowing us glimpses of lost worlds, making us into historians of heritage and connoisseurs of the alien. Though tourists buy physical objects like souvenirs and clothing and great quantities of food and drink, as they once converted wild beasts into travel trophies, what they are actually after is immaterial. Tourists are modernity's paradoxical consumers who seek not merchandise but experience; the attractions of the world draw them with promises of sensation or renewal, inspiration or plain diversion. Experience is hard to commodity Visits can be structured as in safaris and cruises, but the touristic site is only the occasion for the adventure: seeing the Acropolis, touching its stones, is ultimately a prompt for an event that occurs in the mind of the visitor, as the meaning of a performance occurs in the mind of the spectator.\n",

      "Ekphrasisancient and modern: The invention of a genre Abstract In contemporary critical terminology ‘ekphrasis’ has come to be firmly associated with the subject of this journal: word and image. Mention ‘ekphrasis’ to an art historian, literary critic or classicist, and the examples that spring to mind are likely to include the Homeric Shield of Achilles and its many literary imitations, the rhetorical and allegorical descriptions of paintings written by later Greek prose authors, like Lucian and the Elder and Younger Philostratos or, from more recent periods of Western literary history, John Keats' meditation on his tantalisingly still and silent Grecian Urn. This ‘genre’, or ‘trope’, of ekphrasis evokes a network of interlocking questions and interests, from the positivist pursuit of lost monuments described in ancient and medieval ekphrasis to the poststructuralist fascination with a textual fragment which declares itself to be pure artifice, the representation of representation.\n",

      "Dances with Things Proceeding from Robyn Wiegman's call for a transition from questions of \"why\" to \"how\" with regard to formations of race, this article proposes a heuristic, the \"scriptive thing,\" to analyze ways in which racial subjectivation emerges through everyday physical engagement with the material world. The term scriptive thing integrates performance studies and \"thing theory\" by highlighting the ways in which things prompt, structure, or choreograph behavior. A knife, a camera, and a novel all invite—indeed, create occasions for—repetitions of acts, distinctive and meaningful motions of eyes, hands, shoulders, hips, feet. These things are citational in that they arrange and propel bodies in recognizable ways, through paths of evocative movement that have been traveled before. I use the term script as a theatrical professional might, to denote not a rigid dictation of performed action but, rather, a necessary openness to resistance, interpretation, and improvisation. A \"scriptive thing,\" like a play script, broadly structures a performance while unleashing original, live variations. Like the police in Louis Althusser's famous scenario, scriptive things leap out within a field, address an individual, and demand to be reckoned with. By answering a hail, by entering the scripted scenario, the individual is interpellated into ideology and thus into subjecthood. I conduct close readings of scriptive things, including a photograph of a light-skinned woman posing in about 1930 with a caricature of a young African American man, a set of twentieth-century arcade photographs, a viciously racist 1898 alphabet book by E. W. Kemble, and a black doll called \"Uncle Tom\" that was whipped in the 1850s by a white girl who would grow up to write best-selling children's books. These readings show how interpellation occurs through confrontations in the material world, through dances between people and things. ; Other Research Unit ; African and African American Studies ; Version of Record\n",

      "An Expert System for Harmonizing Four-Part Chorales Quite a few trends in algorithmic composition today are based on a streamlined formalism, for example, in the form of random generation of note attributes using elegant statistical distributions (Xenakis 1971), terse and powerful formal grammars (Jones 1981), elegant mathematical models (Kendall 1981; Vaggione 1984), or generalizations of serial composition procedures (Laske 1981). The economy and elegance of the formal representation underlying these musical styles (which are not in the least less respectable than traditional styles of music), may often have an aesthetic appeal in and of themselves. On the other hand, traditional music and most of modern music, which are usually composed without a computer, do not seem to permit such economical representations. In the traditional style, the typical basic training the composer has to go through in harmony, strict counterpoint, fugue,\n",

      "The Geometry of Musical Chords A musical chord can be represented as a point in a geometrical space called an orbifold. Line segments represent mappings from the notes of one chord to those of another. Composers in a wide range of styles have exploited the non-Euclidean geometry of these spaces, typically by using short line segments between structurally similar chords. Such line segments exist only when chords are nearly symmetrical under translation, reflection, or permutation. Paradigmatically consonant and dissonant chords possess different near-symmetries and suggest different musical uses.\n",

      "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose There is apparently a paradox in that, as artists, some of us become progressively process-oriented, but continue to produce art objects. For me this is necessary since I work on two levels from a common set of attitudes: on the social level, elaborating plans for a Cybernetic Art Matrix; on the intimate level making individual art works. Both processes are concerned with creating triggers—initiating creative behaviour in the observer/participant. Modern art is characterized by a behaviourist tendency in which process and system are cardinal factors. As distinctions between music, painting, poetry, etc. become blurred and media are mixed, a bahaviourist synthesis is seen to evolve, in which dialogue and feedback within a social culture indicate the emergence of a Cybernetic vision in art as in science. My artifacts come out of a process of random behaviour interacting with pre-established conditions. The Cybernetic Art Matrix is seen as a process in which anarchic group behaviour interacts with pre-established systems of communications, hardware and learning nets. In both cases the processes are self-generating and self-critical. Basically they are initiated by creative behaviour, and in turn give rise to its extension in other people. \n",

Problems with this kind of program and several schemes that are known not to work are discussed. Several previous computer compositions are discussed, including the ILLIAC Suite. A program to generate short melody fragments was written to simulate some of the aspects of human composition. Five samples of its output are presented and discussed. It was discovered that although the fragments show many of the characteristics of popular melodies, they have a strangely alien sound. It is theorized that this is because the relevant probabilities which would discriminate against unfamiliar sequences were not used.\n",

      "The Functions of Music in Everyday Life: Redefining the Social in Music Psychology What psychological functions does music serve in everyday life? In this paper we argue that the answer to this question is changing as a result of current social and technological changes in music itself, and that these changes force us to re-evaluate the role of the social context in music psychology. After describing the changes we go on to outline the psychological functions of music in everyday life in terms of the cognitive, emotional and social domains. We next attempt a detailed redefinition of the social psychology of music by reviewing the contents of our recent book of this title. The research findings lead us to conclude that the social functions of music are manifested in three principal ways for the individual, namely in the management of self-identity, interpersonal relationships and mood. This leads us to propose a new agenda for music psychology which places the social dimension at its core, and which considers the interdisciplinary context; the effects of the \"democratisation\" of music; the role of theory; the relationship between theory and practice; and the implications for research methodology. \n",

      "Music and the materialization of identities How does music materialize identities? This article argues that music is instructive in conceptualizing the materialization of identity because it opens up new perspectives on issues of materiality, mediation and affect. These perspectives are intimately related in turn to music’s plural socialities, which necessitate a novel approach to theorizing the social. Music, it is proposed, demands an analytics that encompasses four planes of social mediation; while these socialities, with other forms of music’s mediation, together produce a constellation of mediations – an assemblage. All four planes of social mediation enter into the musical assemblage: the first two amount to socialities engendered by musical practice and experience; the last two amount to social and institutional conditions that afford certain kinds of musical practice. The four are irreducible to one another and are articulated in contingent ways through relations of synergy, affordance, conditioning or causality. By adopting the topological metaphor of the plane to stand for distinctive socialities mediated by music, the intention is to highlight both their autonomy and their mutual interference. The second half turns to genre theory to suggest that analysing genre in terms of the mutual mediation between two self-organizing historical entities illuminates both how social identity formations may be refracted in music, and how musical genres can entangle themselves in evolving social formations. Finally, with reference to music’s capacity to create aggregations of the affected, the article considers the efflorescence of theories of affect, association and entrainment. While such theories illuminate the generative nature of the mutual mediation between musical formations and social formations, they are limited by lack of awareness of the four distinctive planes of music’s social mediation, as well as the significance of their autonomy and their contingent interrelations for understanding how music materializes identities.\n",

      "A Lecture on Realism The Big Flame is a play written by Jim Allen, produced by Tony Garnett and directed by Ken Loach for BBC television. I want to discuss it in relation to our understanding of realism. It should be clear at the outset that except in the local vocabulary of particular schools, realism is a highly variable and inherently complex term. In fact, as a term, it only exists in critical vocabulary from the mid-nineteenth century, yet it is clear that methods to which the term refers are very much older. Let me make just one obvious general distinction between conceiving realism in terms of a particular artistic method and conceiving realism in terms of a particular attitude towards what is called 'reality'. Now if, taking the first definition, we concentrate on method, we put ourselves at once in a position in which the method can be seen as timeless: in which it is, so to say, a permanent possibility of choice for any particular artist. Certain things can be learned from this kind of emphasis, but once we become aware of the historical variations within this method, we find ourselves evidently dissatisfied with the abstraction of a method which overrides its relations with other methods within a work or with other aims and intentions.\n",

      "Drama, Performativity, and Performance There is a crisis in drama studies that is reflected in the ways different disciplines understand dramatic texts and performance. Literary studies, absorbed with the functioning of language, often betrays a desire to locate the meanings of the stage in the dramatic text. Performance studies has developed a vivid account of nondramatic performance, which appears to depart from textual authority. Both disciplines, however, view drama as a species of performance driven by its text; as a result, drama appears as an unduly authorized mode of performance. Here, I read a range of critics (Andrew Parker. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Judith Butler on J. L. Austin; Dwight Conquergood on ethnography; Joseph Roach on surrogation) to suggest ways of rethinking the relations of authority that inform texts and performances. I conclude with a glance at the representation of the text in Baz Luhrmann's recent filmWilliam Shakespeare'sRomeo and Juliet.\n",

He suggests that, like any other music, children's compositions can be approached as a quasi-symbolic image of consciousness. The process of skill learning and the act of musical creation are closely connected, even in some sense identical. This way of understanding children's music has implications for the initiation of composition work in class, and for the assessment of that work.\n",

      "Aspects of Well-Formed Scales Pentatonic, diatonic, and chromatic scales share the same underlying structure, that of the well-formed scale. Well-formedness is defined in terms of a relationship between the order in which a single interval generates the elements of a pitch-class set and the order in which those elements appear in a scale. Another characterization provides a recursive procedure for organizing all well-formed scales into hierarchies. Finally, well-formed scales are defined in terms of scale-step measure, and aspects of the diatonic set are examined.

      "The Classical Cadence: Conceptions and Misconceptions The article examines notions traditionally attached to the concept of cadence in general, retains those features finding genuine expression in \"the classical style\" (as defined by the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven), and investigates problematic ideas that have the potential of producing theoretical and analytical confusion. It is argued that cadence effects formal closure only at middle-ground levels of structure; a cadential progression is highly constrained in its harmonic content; cadential function precedes the moment of cadential arrival, whereas the music following this arrival may be postcadential in function; cadential content must be distinguished from cadential function; cadence represents a formal end, not a rhythmic or textural stop; and cadential strength can be distinguished in its syntactical and rhetorical aspects. An analysis of selected musical passages demonstrates that an accurate identification of cadence has a major impact on the interpretation of musical form and phrase structure.\n",

      "Terpsichore in Sneakers: Post-Modern Dance Drawing on the postmodern perspective and concerns that informed her groundbreaking Terpischore in Sneakers, Sally Bane s Writing Dancing documents the background and development of avant-garde and popular dance, analyzing individual artists, performances, and entire dance movements. With a sure grasp of shifting cultural dynamics, Banes shows how postmodern dance is integrally connected to other oppositional, often marginalized strands of dance culture, and considers how certain kinds of dance move from the margins to the mainstream. Banes begins by considering the act of dance criticism itself, exploring its modes, methods, and underlying assumptions and examining the work of other critics. She traces the development of contemporary dance from the early work of such influential figures as Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine to such contemporary choreographers as Molissa Fenley, Karole Armitage, and Michael Clark. She analyzes the contributions of the Judson Dance Theatre and the Workers Dance League, the emergence of Latin postmodern dance in New York, and the impact of black jazz in Russia. In addition, Banes explores such untraditional performance modes as breakdancing and the drunk dancing of Fred Astaire.\"\n",

      "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics On the occasion of its opening in 2002, the Palais de Tokyo immediately struck the visitor as different from other contemporary art venues that had recently opened in Europe. Although a budget of 4.75 million euros was spent on converting the former Japanese pavilion for the 1937 World’s Fair into a “site for contemporary creation,” most of this money had been used to reinforce (rather than renovate) the existing structure.1 Instead of clean white walls, discreetly installed lighting, and wooden floors, the interior was left bare and unfinished. This decision was important, as it reflected a key aspect of the venue’s curatorial ethos under its codirectorship by Jerome Sans, an art critic and curator, and Nicolas Bourriaud, former curator at CAPC Bordeaux and editor of the journal Documents sur l’art. The Palais de Tokyo’s improvised relationship to its surroundings has subsequently become paradigmatic of a visible tendency among European art venues to reconceptualize the “white cube” model of displaying contemporary art as a studio or experimental “laboratory.”2 It is therefore in the tradition of what\n",

Journalistic writing about music is posited on and formed by this prohibition. The music critic may accept it grudgingly, keeping a higher end in view, or he may depend on it to hide what may gently be called his lack of intellectual rigor; in any case, the prohibition is central to his metier.

It is often confronted with an attitude of bemused suspicion implying that there is something weird about taking ‘fun’ seriously or finding ‘fun’ in ‘serious things’. Such attitudes are of considerable interest when discussing the aims and methods of popular music analysis and serve as an excellent introduction to this essay.\n",

      "Judge-Group Differences in the Rating of Secondary School Trumpet Performances It was the purpose of this study to determine whether trumpet performances adjudicated by a group of seven competent brass specialists are rated differently from the same performances adjudicated by a similar group of nonbrass specialists. Its purpose also was to determine whether the performances are rated differently when the same judges were reassigned to judge groups as wind specialists and nonwind specialists. The trait terms used by the judges included intonation, rhythm, interpretation, technique, and overall. The results showed no significant differences for any of the traits when brass judges were compared with nonbrass judges. One trait, technique, was found to be rated significantly different when wind judges were compared with nonwind judges. In addition, technique was also found to be the most distinct trait when the groups of judges were combined into a single judge group and the five rated traits were intercorrelated. \n",

      "‘The magic that can set you free’: the ideology of folk and the myth of the rock community Rock, the saying goes, is ‘the folk music of our time’. Not from a sociological point of view. If ‘folk’ describes pre-capitalist modes of music production, rock is, without a doubt, a mass-produced, mass-consumed, commodity. The rock-folk argument, indeed, is not about how music is made, but about how it works: rock is taken to express (or reflect) a way of life; rock is used by its listeners as a folk music — it articulates communal values, comments on shared social problems. The argument, in other words, is about subcultures rather than musicmaking; the question of how music comes to represent its listeners is begged. (I develop these arguments further in Frith 1978, pp. 191–202, and, with particular reference to punk rock, in Frith 1980.)\n",

      "The Performativity of Performance Documentation Consider two familiar images from the history of performance and body art: one from the documentation of Chris Burden’s Shoot (1971), the notorious piece for which the artist had a friend shoot him in a gallery, and Yves Klein’s famous Leap into the Void (1960), which shows the artist jumping out of a second-story window into the street below. It is generally accepted that the first image is a piece of performance documentation, but what is the second? Burden really was shot in the arm during Shoot, but Klein did not really jump unprotected out the window, the ostensible performance documented in his equally iconic image. What difference does it make to our understanding of these images in relation to the concept of performance documentation that one documents a performance that “really” happened while the other does not? I shall return to this question below. As a point of departure for my analysis here, I propose that performance documentation has been understood to encompass two categories, which I shall call the documentary and the theatrical. The documentary category represents the traditional way in which the relationship between performance art and its documentation is conceived. It is assumed that the documentation of the performance event provides both a record of it through which it can be reconstructed (though, as Kathy O’Dell points out, the reconstruction is bound to be fragmentary and incomplete 1 ) and evidence that it actually occurred. The connection between performance and docu ment is thus thought to be ontological, with the event preceding and authorizing its documentation. Burden’s performance documentation, as well as most of the documentation of classic performance and body art from the 1960s and 1970s, belongs to this category. Although it is generally taken for granted, the presumption of an ontological relationship between performance and document in this first model is ideological. The idea of the documentary photograph as a means of accessing the reality of the performance derives from the general ideology of photography, as described by Helen Gilbert, glossing Roland Barthes and Don Slater: “Through its trivial realism, photography creates the illusion of such exact correspondence between the signifier and the signi fied that it appears to be the perfect instance of Barthes’s ‘message without a code.’ The ‘sense of the photograph as not only representationally accurate but ontologically\n",

      "The Criminal and the Saintly Body: Autopsy and Dissection in Renaissance Italy* On the 17th of August 1308 Chiara of Montefalco died in the small Umbrian monastery of which she had been the abbess. Her fellow nuns did not take any steps to preserve her body. Nonetheless, for five days it remained uncorrupted and redolent of the odor of sanctity, despite the blazing summer heat. At that point— not wanting to tempt fate further—the community decided to embalm the precious relic. In the words of Sister Francesca of Montefalco, testifying some years later at Chiara's unsuccessful canonization procedure, “They agreed that [her] body should be preserved on account of her holiness and because God took such pleasure in her body and her heart.” They sent to the town apothecary for “balsam and myrrh and other preservatives,” as the apothecary himself testified, and they proceeded to the next step in contemporary embalming practice, which was evisceration.\n",

      "Music—Drastic or Gnostic? What does it mean to write about performedmusic? About an opera live and unfolding in time and not an operatic work? Shouldn’t this be whatwe do, since we love music for its reality, for voices and sounds that linger long after they are no longer there? Love is not based on great works as unperformed abstractions or even as subtended by an imagined or hypothetical performance. But would considering actual performances simply involve concert or record reviews? And would musicology—which generally bypasses performance, seeking meanings or formal designs in the immortal musical work itself—find itself a wallflower at the ball? More than forty years ago, Vladimir Jankelevitch made what is still one of the most passionate philosophical arguments for performance, insisting that real music is music that exists in time, the material acoustic phenomenon. Metaphysical mania encourages us to retreat from real music to the abstraction of the work and, furthermore, always to see, as he put it, “something else,” something behind or beyond or next to this mental object. Yet, as he wrote, “composing music, playing it, and singing it; or even hearing it in recreating it—are these not three modes of doing, three attitudes that are drastic, not gnostic, not of the hermeneutic order of knowledge?”Musical sounds are made by labor. And it is in the irreversible experience of playing, singing, or listening that anymeanings summoned bymusic come into being. Retreating to the work displaces that experience, and dissecting the work’s technical features or saying what it represents reflects the wish\n",

      "Performance, Utopia, and the \"Utopian Performative\" This essay is a rumination of sorts, the beginning of an inquiry into the ways in which performance might provide us with experiences of utopia. How can perform ance, in itself, be a Utopian gesture? Why do people come together to watch other people labor on stage, when contemporary culture solicits their attention with myriad other forms of representation and opportunities for social gathering? Why do people continue to seek the liveness, the present-tenseness that performance and theatre offer? Is the desire to be there, in the moment, an expression of a Utopian impulse? Certainly, people are drawn to theatre and performance by fashion and by taste, by the need to collect the cultural capital that theatre going provides. Live theatre remains a powerful site at which to establish and exchange notions of cultural taste, to set standards, and to model fashions, trends, and styles.\n",

      "Effect of Magnitude of Conductor Behavior on Students in Selected Mixed Choruses The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of magnitude of conductor behavior on performance, attentiveness, and attitude of students in mixed choruses. Four mixed choruses (one university and three high schools) were rehearsed under three conditions: (1) with regular conductor, (2) with high magnitude conductor, and (3) with low magnitude conductor. Magnitude was defined a priori by the experimenter and subsequently observed using the Music Conductor Observation Form developed for this study. In addition the effect of magnitude was measured by (1) judges' ratings of audiotaped musical performances, (2) behavioral observation of student attentiveness, and (3) self-report of student attitude. Although results indicated no significant differences in musical performance, attentiveness, or attitude ratings among baseline and the two experimental conditions, high and low magnitude, three of the groups received their lowest ratings under the low magnitude condition, off-task percentage was lower during the high magnitude condition, and data demonstrated student preference for the high magnitude conductor. \n",

      "Caribbean and African Appropriations of \"The Tempest\" The era from the late fifties to the early seventies was marked in Africa and the Caribbean by a rush of newly articulated anticolonial sentiment that was associated with the burgeoning of both international black consciousness and more localized nationalist movements. Between 1957 and 1973 the vast majority of African and the larger Caribbean colonies won their independence; the same period witnessed the Cuban and Algerian revolutions, the latter phase of the Kenyan \"Mau Mau\" revolt, the Katanga crisis in the Congo, the Trinidadian Black Power uprising and, equally important for the atmosphere of militant defiance, the civil rights movement in the United States, the student revolts of 1968, and the humbling of the United States during the Vietnam War. This period was distinguished, among Caribbean and African intellectuals, by a pervasive mood of optimistic outrage. Frequently graduates of British or French universities, they were the first generation from their regions self-assured and numerous enough to call collectively for a renunciation of Western standards as the political revolts found their cultural counterparts in insurrections against the bequeathed values of the colonial powers. In the context of such challenges to an increasingly discredited European colonialism, a series of dissenting intellectuals chose to utilize a\n",

      "Sharing The Dance. Contact Improvisation and American Culture Cynthia J. Novack New Directions in Anthropological Writing. University of Wisconsin Press: Madison, Wisconsin 1990, xvii + 258pp., £23.95 Growing out of the 1960s avant-garde and counterculture, contact improvization is an underground, experimental movement in modern dance that captures artistic and social forces in transition. Cynthia Novack considers the development of this dance form within its historical, social and cultural contexts. While focusing on the changing practice of contact improvization, Novack's work incorporates the history of rock dancing and disco, modern dance and experimental dance movements and a variety of other physical activities, such as martial arts, aerobics and wrestling. Providing a cultural history of a number of American dance/movement styles from the 1950s to the present, she also compares contact improvization to other dance forms, both American and non-American. Novack concludes her study with a discussion of contact improvization both as an icon of the end of the 1960s and as a dance practice which continues to demonstrate the subtle ways in which movement represents and creates culture.\n",

      "The Body as Archive: Will to Re-Enact and the Afterlives of Dances Laurence Louppe once advanced the intriguing notion that the dancer is “the veritable avatar of Orpheus: he has no right to turn back on his course, lest he be denied the object of his quest” (Louppe 1994, 32). However, looking across the contemporary dance scene in Europe and the United States, one cannot escape the fact that dancers—contrary to Orpheus, contrary to Louppe's assertion—are increasingly turning back on their and dance history's tracks in order to find the “object of their quest.” Indeed, contemporary dancers and choreographers in the United States and Europe have in recent years been actively engaged in creating re-enactments of sometimes well-known, sometimes obscure, dance works of the twentieth century. Examples abound: we can think of Fabian Barba's Schwingende Landschaft (2008), an evening-length piece where the Ecuadorian choreographer returns to Mary Wigman's seven solo pieces created in 1929 and performed during Wigman's first U.S. tour in 1930; of Elliot Mercer returning in 2009 and 2010 to several of Simone Forti's Construction Pieces (1961/62), performing them at Washington Square Park in New York City; or Anne Collod's 2008 return to Anna Halprin's Parades and Changes (1965), among many other examples.\n",

      "Perceptual evaluations of synthesized musical instrument tones An analysis-based synthesis technique for the computer generation of musical instrument tones was perpetually evaluated in terms of the discriminability of 16 original and resynthesized tones taken from a wide class of orchestral instruments having quasiharmonic series. The analysis technique used was the heterodyne filter—which produced a set of intermediate data for additive synthesis, consisting of time-varying amplitude and frequency functions for the set of partials of each tone. Three successive levels of data reduction were applied to this intermediate data, producing types of simplified signals that were also compared with the original and resynthesized tones. The results of this study, in which all combinations of signals were compared, demonstrated the perceptual closeness of the original and directly resynthesized tones. An orderly relationship was found between the form of data reduction incurred by the signals and their relative discriminability, measured by a modified AAAB discrimination procedure. Direct judgments of the relative sizes of the differences between the tones agreed with these results; multidimensional scaling of the latter data provided a visual display of the relationships among the different forms of tones and pointed out the importance of certain small details existing in the attack segments of tones. Of the three forms of simplification attempted with the tones, the most successful was a line-segment approximation to time-varying amplitude and frequency functions for the partials. The pronounced success of this modification strongly suggests that many of the microfluctuations usually found in the analyzed physical attributes of music instrument tones have little perceptual significance.\n",

      "Abstracts Objective: To study selective regional binding for tau pathology in vivo, using PET with [11C]PBB3 ([11C]methylamino pyridin-3-yl buta-1,3-dienyl benzo[d]thiazol-6-ol) in tauopathies, and in conditions not typically associated with tauopathy. Background: Tau imaging is a promising tool to study the link between tau and neurodegeneration. The specificity of tracers in vivo however remains uncertain, and off target binding is frequently present, limiting its use in parkinsonian disorders. Methods: Dynamic PET scans were obtained for 70 min after the bolus injection of [11C]PBB3 (mean dose 518.97MBq) in five PSP subjects, 1 subject with DCTN1 mutation and PSP phenotype,3 asymptomatic SNCA duplication carriers, 1 MSA subject, and 7 healthy controls of similar age. The occipital cortex was used as reference region for the PSP , the DCTN1 mutation and the MSA subjects. The cerebellar white matter was used as a reference region for the SNCA duplication carriers. Tissue reference Logan analysis was applied to each region of interest (ROI) using the appropriate reference region. Results: In PSP subjects, the highest retention of [11C]PBB3 was observed in putamen, midbrain, globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Longer disease duration and more advanced clinical severity were generally associated with higher tracer retention. The DCTN1/PSP phenotype case showed increased binding in putamen, parietal lobe, and globus pallidus. In SNCA duplication carriers there was a significant increase of [11C] PBB3 binding compared to controls in globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, and pedunculopontine nucleus. The MSA case showed increased binding in comparison to the control group in frontal lobe, globus pallidus, midbrain, parietal lobe, putamen, temporal lobe, substantia nigra, thalamus and ventral striatum. Conclusions: All PSP patients showed increased retention of the tracer in the basal ganglia, as clinically expected. However, binding was also present in asymptomatic SNCA duplication carriers as well as the subject with MSA, which are not typically associated with pathological tau deposition. This suggests the possibility that [11C]PBB3 binds to alpha-synuclein or other proteins involved in neurodegeneration. (Less)\n",

      "An Historical Overview of the Preparation of the UNESCO International Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage This article reviews the different factors which generated international standard setting for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage, examines the conceptual evolution of this notion, and traces the various steps of negotiations leading to the adoption of the Convention in 2003. The establishment of the first normative instrument was the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore (1989). Much attention had been given to the question of Intellectual Property Rights, which at the end was left aside for a more global approach. In 1997, the World Forum on the Protection of Folklore, organized by UNESCO and WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organization), concluded that the copyright regime was not adequate for ensuring protection, but that a new international agreement was needed. The 1992 UNESCO 'Intangible Cultural Heritage' programme consolidated by the UNESCO/Japan Fund-in-Trust, the creation of a world list of Living Human Treasures in 1993, the 1992 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, and the subsequent setting-up of the United Nations decade for indigenous and minority people (1995-2004) generated a number of significant events in favour of the safeguarding of intangible heritage and made urgent the need for a new normative instrument. The Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity was conceived in 1997 as a means to fill the gap in the concept of 'world heritage', which refers mainly to the 'Northern' natural and tangible cultural heritage. The Assessment of the 1989 Recommendation played a catalytic role for the successful adoption of the 2003 Convention, in which a more holistic conception of 'heritage' prevailed, with a predominant role given to artists, practitioners and communities deserving of respect and motivation. This Convention marks a fundamental ethical positioning.\n",

The definition can be decomposed into basic expectancy components projected by each time interval implicit in the sequence. A preliminary formulation of these basic curves is proposed and the (de) composition method is stated in a formalized, mathematical way. The resulting expectancy of complex temporal patterns can be used to model such diverse topics as categorical rhythm perception, clock and meter inducement, rhythmicity, and the similarity of temporal sequences. Besides expectancy projected into the future, the proposed measure can be projected back into the past as well, generating reinforcement of past events by new data. The consistency of the predictions of the theory with some findings in categorical rhythm perception is shown.\n",

      "Computer-Assisted Composition at IRCAM: From PatchWork to OpenMusic In recent years, IRCAM has been exploring and developing software for computer-assisted composition (CAC). These software packages allow composers and musicologists to formalize and experiment with the structures and dynamics of musical languages. The Formes program (Rodet and Cointe 1984), although primarily devoted to the control of sound synthesis, was really a compositional environment with a high-level object-oriented architecture. The Crime environment (Assayag, Castellengo, and Malherbe 1985; Amiot, Assayag, Malherbe, and Riotte 1986) was the first attempt at IRCAM to realize a general CAC environment where the user could define and control abstract musical formalisms. Francis Courtot developed CARLA as an attempt to use a visual programming interface to a Prolog-based logic-programming system (Balaban, Ebcioglu, and Laske 1992). The development of the PatchWork environment, by M. Laurson, J. Duthen, and C. Rueda (Laurson and Duthen 1989; Laurson 1996), was the next stage in the development of CAC programs at IRCAM. The combination of programming simplicity and a highly visual interface in a personal computing concept created an infatuation with PatchWork among European composers with highly diverse musical and aesthetic backgrounds, including Antoine Bonnet, Michel Fano, Brian Ferneyhough, Gerard Grisey, Paavo Heininen, Magnus Lindberg, Claudy Malherbe, Tristan Murail, Kaija Saariaho, and many others. OpenMusic, designed by G. Assayag and C. Agon (Assayag, Agon, Fineberg, and Hanappe 1997; Agon, Assayag, Delerue, and Rueda 1998), is the most recent IRCAM CAC environment. It is a visual interface to CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System (Steele 1990). Aside from being a superset of PatchWork, it opens new territories by allowing the composer to visually design sophisticated musical object classes. It introduces the maquette concept, which enables high-level control of musical material over time, and it revises the PatchWork visual language in a modern way.\n",

      "Space-form and the acousmatic image AbstractThe analytical discussion of acousmatic music can benefit from being based on spatial concepts, and this article aims to provide a framework for investigation. A personal experience of soundscape listening is the starting point, and uncovers basic ideas relating to the disposition and behaviour of sounding content, and listening strategy. This enables the opening out of the discussion to include source-bonded sounds in general, giving particular consideration to how experience of sense modes other than the aural are implicated in our understanding of space, and in acousmatic listening. Attention then shifts to a source-bonded spatial model based on the production of space by the gestural activity of music performance, prior to focusing in more detail on acousmatic music, initially by delving into spectral space, where ideas about gravitation and diagonal forces are germane. This leads to concepts central to the structuring of perspectival space in relation to the vantage point of the listener. The final section considers a methodology for space-form investigation.\n",

      "GROOVE—a program to compose, store, and edit functions of time A program which makes possible creating, storing, reproducing, and editing functions of time is described. The functions are typical of those generated by human beings. Multiple functions (up to 14) are produced for long periods of time (up to severol hours) at sufficiently high sampling rates to describe fast human reactions (up to 200 samples per second). The functions can be used for a variety of purposes such as the control of machine tools or sound synthesizers or anything a person normally controls. The program operates on a small computer (DDP-224). Functions are stored on a disk file. Functions may be created by real-time human inputs to the computer which can interact with already stored functions and computed functions. Realtime feedback from the process being controlled is an important link in the system. The environment for effective manmachine interaction has been carefully nurtured.\n",

      "In Defence of Selfish Genes and genetically quite impossible situation' (p. 440), and as a 'grossly simplified and distorted scheme' (p. 444). But of course it is abstract, simplified and distorted. This is what models are, and that is what gives them their usefulness. It is the very property which made my model useful to Mackie and which stimulated his useful contribution. Models do not aspire to mimic reality faithfully. If they did, they would not be models, they would be reality. In physics, for instance, it is sometimes convenient to imagine a body-it may even be described as a traintravelling at nearly the speed of light past an observer, who sees the passengers hideously foreshortened. Only a pedant would point out that trains can't go that fast, and that in any case the observer wouldn't have time to see the passengers. If a philosopher made such an objection against the writings of a particular physicist, we could justly conclude that he or she did not understand the first thing about physics, since all physicists make use of such simplified models. Yet this is almost exactly the nature of Midgley's objection to my 'grudger/sucker/cheat' model. If she had objected that it was a bad model I would have listened sympathetically, but that is not what she did. She appears not to have understood that it was a model at all. In the present state of evolutionary biology, the preferred models embody various kinds of deliberate simplification, and one of the most fashionable of these deliberate simplifications is the 'one gene one strategy' model that worries Midgley so much. I am only one of many biologists for whom it is a convenient weapon in our theoretical armoury. Others who frequently wield it include J. Maynard Smith and E. 0. Wilson, to name two biologists whom Midgley singles out for special praise in her article. It is ironic that she should compare my 'gene-selection' treatment of the paradox of sex, to its disadvantage, with a passage from John Maynard Smith's rightly praised The Evolution of Sex (Cambridge University Press, I978). Like nearly all Maynard Smith's works, this book abounds in simplified models of exactly the kind Midgley castigates. If she had read beyond the Preface to page II13, Midgley would have found Maynard\n",

It focuses on rock and folk genres, but also argues that the generic nature of the typology makes it applicable to any other genre wherein listeners are concerned to ask whether a musical utterance can be construed as sincere.\n",

      "Mutual Learning and Democratic Action in Instrumental Music Education This ethnography is an investigation of the notion of democracy as community-in-the-making. The researcher and nine band students came together to create music that was meaningful and self-reflective. The participants elected to split into two distinct ensembles. Group 1 chose not to compose on their primary band instruments, opting for electric guitar, bass, synthesized piano, and drums. Group 2 chose to create music using traditional concert band instruments. Choosing a genre and working with the traditions governing its creative processes seemed to be the largest determinant of a groups culture. The group members and researcher saw classical music as unproductive for group composing or community-making. Composing in a jazz or popular style was conceived of as fun, nonobligatory, self-directed, and personally meaningful. In such settings, there was an emphasis on interpersonal relationships, peer learning and peer critique, as well as an expectation that members will take care of each other. \n",

      "The Aesthetics of Failure: “Post-Digital” Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music Over the past decade, the Internet has helped spawn a new movement in digital music. It is not academically based, and for the most part the composers involved are self-taught. Music journalists occupy themselves inventing names for it, and some have already taken root: glitch, microwave, DSP, sinecore, and microscopic music. These names evolved through a collection of deconstructive audio and visual techniques that allow artists to work beneath the previously impenetrable veil of digital media. The Negroponte epigraph above inspired me to refer to this emergent genre as “post-digital” because the revolutionary period of the digital information age has surely passed. The tendrils of digital technology have in some way touched everyone. With electronic commerce now a natural part of the business fabric of the Western world and Hollywood cranking out digital fluff by the gigabyte, the medium of digital technology holds less fascination for composers in and of itself. In this article, I will emphasize that the medium is no longer the message; rather, specific tools themselves have become the message. The Internet was originally created to accelerate the exchange of ideas and development of research between academic centers, so it is perhaps no surprise that it is responsible for helping give birth to new trends in computer music outside the confines of academic think tanks. A non-academic composer can search the Internet for tutorials and papers on any given aspect of computer music to obtain a good, basic understanding of it. University computer music centers breed developers whose tools are shuttled around the Internet and used to develop new music outside the university. Unfortunately, cultural exchange between nonacademic artists and research centers has been lacking. The post-digital music that Max, SMS, AudioSculpt, PD, and other such tools make possible rarely makes it back to the ivory towers, yet these non-academic composers anxiously await new tools to make their way onto a multitude of Web sites. Even in the commercial software industry, the marketing departments of most audio software companies have not yet fully grasped the post-digital aesthetic; as a result, the more unusual tools emanate from developers who use their academic training to respond to personal creative needs. This article is an attempt to provide feedback to both academic and commercial music software developers by showing how current DSP tools are being used by post-digital composers, affecting both the form and content of contemporary “non-academic“ electronic music.\n",

      "Elementary Student Attending Behavior as a Function of Classroom Activities This study investigated the extent to which attending behavior (on-task participation) of students in elementary music classes is a function of the activities in which students engage. On-task behavior also was examined for possible relationships with teachers and curriculum. A total of 262 in-class observations of 10 to 20 minutes each were conducted at all grade levels (K-6) taught by 11 elementary music teachers during one academic year. An interval recording technique was used to record the number of students judged to be off-task during a series of 15-second intervals. Symbols representing 11 different activities were placed on the form. Factor analysis produced significantly different levels of off-task behavior relating to activity, teacher, and curriculum. Such activities as playing instruments and singing yielded low levels of off-task behavior; students showed higher off-task levels during periods of “getting ready” for activities and during periods in which teachers and students were interacting verbally. A significant interaction occurred between teacher and activity only when the “getting ready” activity was included in the analysis. Off-task levels did not correlate significantly with the amount of time spent on the various activities. These results suggest that attending behavior is, in part, a function of the nature of the activity in which students participate. \n",

      "Semiotics of Theatrical Performance According to Jorge Luis Borges, Abulgualid Mohammed Ibn Ahmed Ibn Mohammahd Ibn Rushd, better known as Averroes, was thinking—something like one thousand years ago, more or less—about a difficult question concerning Aristotle's Poetics. As you probably know, Averroes was a specialist on Aristotle, mainly on the Poetics. As a matter of fact, Western civilization had lost this book and had rediscovered it only through the mediation of Arab philosophers. Averroes did not know about theatre. Because of the Muslim taboo on representation, he had never seen a theatrical performance. At least, Borges, in his short story The Quest of Averroes, imagines our philosopher wondering about two incomprehensible words he had found in Aristotle, namely “tragedy” and “comedy.” A nice problem, since Aristotle's Poetics is nothing else but a complex definition of those two words, or at least of the first of them.\n",

      "The Museum: Its Classical Etymology and Renaissance Genealogy As a concept which expressed a pattern of activity transcending the strict confines of museum itself, the idea of musaeum was an apt metaphor for the encyclopaedic tendencies of the period. Linguistically, musaeum was a bridge between social and intellectual life, moving effortlessly between these two realms, and in fact pointing to the fluidity and instability of categories such as ‘social’ and ’intellectual’, and ‘public’ and ‘private’, as they were defined during the late Renaissance. The etymology of museum is itself a fascinating subject for study. In reviving the liberal arts, the humanists self-consciously placed themselves in the grove of the Muses, creating ‘museums’ as they did so, to stress their direct ties with ancient wisdom. The growth of humanist circles in the courts, churches, academies and publishing houses of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe signalled the beginnings of a more social and contemporaneous setting for the Muses.\n",

The author contends that notions about the nature and function of music are embedded in the structure of software-based music systems and that interactions with these systems tend to reveal characteristics of the community of thought and culture that produced them.

      "‘Verbatim Theatre’: Oral History and Documentary Techniques ‘Verbatim Theatre’ has been the term utilized by Derek Paget during his extensive researches into that form of documentary drama which employs (largely or exclusively) tape-recorded material from the ‘real-life’ originals of the characters and events to which it gives dramatic shape. Though clearly indebted to sources such as the radio ballads of the 'fifties, and to the tradition which culminated in Joan Littlewood's Oh what a Lovely War, most of its practitioners acknowledge Peter Cheeseman's work at Stoke-on-Trent as the direct inspiration - in one case, as first received through the ‘Production Casebook’ on his work published in the first issue of the original Theatre Quarterly (1971). Quite simply, the form owes its present health and exciting potential to the flexibility and unobtrusiveness of the portable cassette recorder - ironically, a technological weapon against which are ranged other mass technological media such as broadcasting and the press, which tend to marginalize the concerns and emphases of popular oral history. Here, Derek Paget, who is currently completing his doctoral thesis on this subject, discusses with leading practitioners their ideas and working methods. Derek Paget teaches English and Drama at Worcester College of Higher Education, and has also had practical theatre experience ranging from community work to the West End, and from Joan Littlewood's final season at Stratford East to the King's Head, Islington.\n",

We model this process mathematically, showing that it produces 32 equivalence relations on chords, 243 equivalence relations on chord sequences, and 32 families of geometrical quotient spaces, in which both chords and chord sequences are represented. This model reveals connections between music-theoretical concepts, yields new analytical tools, unifies existing geometrical representations, and suggests a way to understand similarity between chord types.\n",

      "The dynamics of dynamics: A model of musical expression A computational model of musical dynamics is proposed that complements an earlier model of expressive timing. The model, implemented in the artificial intelligence language LISP, is based on the observation that a musical phrase is often indicated by a crescendo/decrescendo shape. The functional form of this shape is derived by making two main assumptions. First, that musical dynamics and tempo are coupled, that is, ‘‘the faster the louder, the slower the softer.’’ This tempo/dynamics coupling, it is suggested, may be a characteristic of some classical and romantic styles perhaps exemplified by performances of Chopin. Second, that the tempo change is governed by analogy to physical movement. The allusion of musical expression to physical motion is further extended by the introduction of the concepts of energy and mass. The utility of the model, in addition to giving an insight into the nature of musical expression, is that it provides a basis for a method of performance style analysis.\n",

      "Formal and informal learning situations or practices vs formal and informal ways of learning During the last decade there has been an awakening interest in considering not only formalised learning situations within institutional settings, but also all the various forms of informal musical learning practices outside schools. Informal musical learning outside institutional settings has been shown to contribute to important knowledge and aspects of music education. In this article, I will examine research studies which in different ways focus on formal and informal learning situations and practices or formal and informal ways of learning. I will consider the relationship between music education as praxis (music pedagogy) and as research, and the relationship between these two facets of music education and the surrounding society. I will identify four different ways of using and defining formal and informal learning, respectively, either explicitly or implicitly, each one focusing on different aspects of learning: (i) the situation, (ii) learning style, (iii) ownership, and (iv) intentionality. Formal – informal should not be regarded as a dichotomy, but rather as the two poles of a continuum; in most learning situations, both these aspects of learning are in various degrees present and interacting. Music education researchers, in order to contribute to the attainment of a multiplicity of learning styles and a cultural diversity in music education, need to focus not only on the formal and informal musical learning in Western societies and cultures, but also to include the full global range of musical learning in popular, world and indigenous music in their studies.\n",

      "Choreopolice and Choreopolitics: or, the task of the dancer The choreographic element in Jacques Rancière's notion of “police” is used to advance the concept of “choreopolice,” which can then be set in opposition to “choreopolitics” to redefine “choreography” and release it from imperative, or normative (i.e., policed) constructions of movement. Hannah Arendt's notion that freedom is the telos of politics identifies how within several types of choreography (TURF street dance, Tania Bruguera's Arte de Conducta, and Sarah Michelson's Devotion Study #1 — The American Dancer), the dancer's task is to search and enact that freedom, over and over again. \n",

      "Choreographies of Protest This essay reconstructs nonviolent protest during three moments in recent US history—the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960, the ACT-UP die-ins of the late 1980s, and the Seattle WTO protests in 1999, asking of them the kinds of questions that a dance scholar might pose. By showing how bodies make articulate choices based on their intelligent assessment of other bodies, the essay frames a new perspective on individual agency and collective action. \n",

      "Music Theory and the White Racial Frame For over twenty years, music theory has tried to diversify with respect to race, yet the field today remains remarkably white, not only in terms of the people who practice music theory but also in the race of the composers and theorists whose work music theory privileges. In this paper, a critical-race examination of the field of music theory, I try to come to terms with why this is so. I posit that there exists a “white racial frame” in music theory that is structural and institutionalized, and that only through a deframing and reframing of this white racial frame will we begin to see positive racial changes in music theory.\n",

      "A Generative Grammar for Jazz Chord Sequences The recursive character of musical chord sequences makes generative grammar a suitable formalism for describing the rules that constrain such sequences. A small number of rules are presented which generate the members of a large class of complex chord sequences that are generally recognised to be closely related, namely the set of jazz 12-bar blues. The rules are illustrated using a testing corpus of jazz chord sequences, and certain extensions are considered.\n",

      "PERFORMANCE AS METAPHOR Performance is clearly one of those terms that Raymond Williams calls \"keywords,\" or words (e.g., realism, naturalism, mimesis, structure) whose meanings are \"inextricably bound up with the problems [they are] being used to discuss.\"' Find a word that is suddenly emerging from normal semantic practice (a word you are hearing, say, a dozen times a week), and you can bet that it is a proto-keyword spreading on the winds of metaphor. And in this process the word's standard dictionary meanings seem to fall into a dormancy while the new \"key\" meaning, not yet clear, gets tested and extended far and wide, revised, qualified, and finally settles into the vocabulary as if it had always meant what it now means.2\n",

      "The New Brutalism OCTOBER 136, Spring 2011, pp. 19–28. © Architectural Review, December 1955, pp. 354–61. In this seminal essay, Reyner Banham brings together a number of the key terms that had been gathering around New Brutalism, defining the movement in three theses: “1, Memorability as an Image; 2, Clear exhibition of Structure; and 3, Valuation of Material ‘as found.’” New Brutalism’s revision of the modern movement, Banham argues, is partly the work of his generation of architectural historians, who had recently begun to write its history. Banham also rethinks his response to Parallel of Life and Art here, seeing in the exhibition a powerful example of how image and texture might be bound together.—A.K.\n",

      "The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the System of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson (review) The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the system of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson. By Hans-Jorg Uther. FF Communications no. 284. Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2004. Three volumes: 619 pp., 536 pp., 285 pp. The concept of a \"tale type\" arises in human experience. When people apply their innate capacity for abstracting to their experience of hearing a story in different words or with different features, they invent a concept of sameness. In folkloristic scholarship, the concept enabled anti-romantic Finnish scholars, beginning in the 1880s, to apply scientific methods, treat every recurrent plot as an entity, and establish to their satisfaction that each tale originated with a single author (monogenesis) and spread from a single point of origin (diffusion). When the American Stith Thompson took up the Finn Antti Aarne's Verzeichnis der Marchentypen (1910) and translated and enlarged it into The Types of the Folktale (1928, 1961), the catalog became indispensable to scholars tracking versions and variants of \"The Animal Languages,\" \"The Bremen Town Musicians,\" \"Cinderella,\" and all the other hundreds of recurrent plots, now labeled and classified. The type concept was a territorial claim for scientific folkloristics: it asserted that the folktale, or marchen, was something existing in the world, and to study it would connect the natural and the human sciences. While the historic-geographic method underwent criticisms, the type concept it engendered survived. Its catalog too was criticized on major grounds which Hans-Jorg Uther succinctly summarizes (1:7-8) as a prelude to his masterly improvement on Aarne and Thompson (AT). Now Uther has brought the catalog up to date. His admirable work, already nicknamed ATU, transforms the folktale catalog into \"an effective tool that permits international tale types to be located quickly\" (1:8). So it brings in a new era. Those who used the predecessor will have no difficulty rinding their way around the revision. They will note the contributions made by co-workers Sabine Dinslage, Sigrid Fahrmann, and Gudrun Schwibbe and will be grateful for Christine Goldberg's vetting of the translations. They will marvel at the speed with which the team, aided by the resources of the Enzyklopadie des Marchens, have brought forward the project. They will cheer its improvements, beginning with its logical four-pan division-animal tales, tales of magic, religious tales, realistic tales-to replace the illogical divisions of AT. Type numbers have been regularized, hence are easier to use. \"Irregular\" types have been eliminated. Tale descriptions, titles, and interconnections have been rationalized, to the relief of readers who found AT insufficiently informative and too narrow in focus. A typical entry summarizes the tale's general shape, gives facts \"about the tale's age, place of origin, the extent of its tradition, or other distinctive features\" (13), and lists the most important bibliographical sources; these appear in the excellent appendix. Then, upholding the original historic-geographic hypothesis that each tale must have its own life history, the author shows \"the geographic spread of the tale type\" by listing the many published catalogs of types and motifs, and also numerous versions supplied from the files of the Enzyklopadie des Marchens. …\n",

      "Popular music education in and for itself, and for ‘other’ music: current research in the classroom This article considers some ways in which the school classroom enters into, changes and complicates musical meanings, focusing particularly on the role of popular music and how it relates to classical music. I suggest that in bringing popular music into the curriculum, educators have largely ignored the informal learning practices of popular musicians. Popular music has therefore been present as curriculum content, but its presence has only recently begun to affect our teaching strategies. I examine how the adaptation of some informal popular music learning practices for classroom use can positively affect pupils' musical meanings and experiences. This applies not only to the sphere of popular music, but also to classical music and, by implication, other musics as well. Finally, the notions of musical autonomy, personal autonomy and musical authenticity in relation to musical meaning and informal learning practices within the classroom are discussed. \n",

      "Feeling Brown: Ethnicity and Affect in Ricardo Bracho's The Sweetest Hangover (and Other STDs) The theoretical incoherence of the identity demarcation \"Latino\" is linked to the term's failure to actualize embodied politics which contest the various antagonisms within the social that challenge Latino/a citizen-subjects. While important political spectacles have been staged under group identity titles such as Chicano and Nuyorican, Latino, a term meant to enable much-needed coalitions between different national groups, has not developed as an umbrella term that unites cultural and political activists across different national, racial, class, and gender divides. This problem has to do with its incoherence, by which I mean the term's inability to index, with any regularity, the central identity tropes that lead to our understandings of group identities in the United States. \"Latino\" does not subscribe to a common racial, class, gender, religious, or national category, and if a Latino can be from any country in Latin America, a member of any race, religion, class, or gender/sex orientation, who then is she? What, if any, nodes of commonality do Latinas /os share? How is it possible to know latinidad?\n",
